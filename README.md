# Cybersecurity & Networking Labs

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains **hands-on cybersecurity and networking labs** designed to demonstrate practical skills in enterprise networking, routing, switching, and security fundamentals.

All labs are built with a **learn-by-doing approach** and documented to reflect real-world troubleshooting, configuration, and validation practices.

The primary goal of this repository is to serve as:
- A **portfolio of technical lab work**
- A **resume-backed proof of hands-on experience**
- A **personal knowledge base** for networking and cybersecurity concepts
