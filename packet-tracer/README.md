# Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS) VLAN Inter-VLAN Routing Lab

## 📌 Overview
This lab demonstrates **Router-on-a-Stick (ROAS)** configuration to enable **inter-VLAN routing** using a single router interface with multiple subinterfaces. The goal is to allow hosts on different VLANs to communicate while remaining logically segmented.

This lab was built and tested in **Cisco Packet Tracer** and focuses on foundational enterprise networking concepts.

## 🧠 Concepts Covered
- VLAN creation and segmentation  
- 802.1Q trunking  
- Router subinterfaces  
- Inter-VLAN routing  
- Default gateway configuration  
- Layer 2 vs Layer 3 separation  

---

## 🛠️ Network Topology
- **1 Router**
- **1 Layer 2 Switch**
- **Multiple End Devices**
- **Single trunk link between switch and router**
